## genesig.R  
This script facilitates significance testing of gene expression arrays. To use this script:
  * Download genesig.R
  * Open a terminal/shell prompt
  * Execute `R` in the terminal
  * Type `source("path_to_genesig")`. 
      * Tip: type `source("` and then drag the script into your prompt to quickly obtain the filepath. Finish the command by adding a `")` with no spaces.
  * Next, type and execute `genesig("path_to_input_data")`. As before, if unfamiliar with navigating in the terminal, you can simply drag the file into the function to obtain the filepath.
  * Follow any remaining prompts.
  * If successful, the results of significance testing will be in the same directory as the input data.
